What we will build üë©‚Äçüíª:

Following [my blog post](https://www.novoda.com/blog/getting-started-with-arkit/) on how to get stated with ARKit we will go through creating a starting AR app on XCode and build different ways to create a models on an AR environment.

- Setting up a Scene with a custom 3D model, you can download some custom 3D models from [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/) or [SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/) we will be using the models on the `art.scnassets` folder

- Set the app to react to user touch and add models at specific touch locations, you can use a basic `SCNBox` or any model you have added to the project

- Add a model on a touch location with lights, shadows and animations imported from the model file

We will have a demo and ready to show app after every point and we will code along and explain every part for beginners.

This are the models we will be using on the demo:

- [TARS by Chris Basha](https://www.novoda.com/blog/designing-for-ar-with-arkit/)

You can download your own and convert the `.obj` file into `.scn` directly on XCode
